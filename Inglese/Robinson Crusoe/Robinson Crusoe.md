In the book Robinson Crusoe i would change the mentality of the protagonist because in a modern era is no admissible to indoctrinate others, and converting people isn't anymore a quality. The story have to change consequently but could remain pretty much the same story. Is possible to add technology or diminishing the skill set of Robinson but is better to not change too much the story because if you change too much the story is turn in another story, and this isn't the request so in conclusion the changes would be minimal because the risk to turn the story in another story is very high.
